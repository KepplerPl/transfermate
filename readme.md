# TransferMate Project

1. Getting started

1.1 Go to src/apopa/config.json and complete the "database" entry with valid database credentials.

1.2 Run the "generateDummyData.php" file in order to generate some data for the cron job.

1.3 Run the "cronJob.php" in order to populate the database.

2. Mentions

2.1 There was no optimization done for the cron job. Nor for the search with large amounts of data.

2.2 There is no animation for the author/books list. I'm not too familiar with javascript and quite frankly I don't enjoy working in frontend very much. I'm more of a backend guy.

2.3 The database used was MySQL simply because I have no Postgre at hand. Even if I did I'm not at all familiar with Postgre thus I would have been unable to use it properly.
